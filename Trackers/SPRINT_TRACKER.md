# DailyForge — Sprint Tracker

**28 tickets + 1 health check shipped across 6 sprints (React PWA).**
**Sprint 7+: Flutter rebuild for Android.**

---

## 🚀 MAJOR PIVOT: Flutter Rebuild (Decided Apr 13, 2026)

### Decision Summary
- **Frontend:** React PWA → Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express → **NO CHANGE** (same API)
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL → **NO CHANGE**
- **Target:** Android first (Google Play), iOS later

### Why Flutter?
- Better video playback and animations
- Smaller app size (10-20 MB vs 20-40 MB PWA+TWA)
- Native performance for media-heavy app
- Used by Down Dog (our main competitor)

### Folder Structure
```
D:\projects\
├── dailyforge/              ← Keep for backend + reference
│   ├── client/              ← OLD React app (reference only)
│   ├── server/              ← Backend API (KEEP FOREVER)
│   └── Trackers/            ← All tracker files
│
└── dailyforge_flutter/      ← NEW Flutter app (Sprint 7+)
    ├── lib/
    ├── android/
    └── pubspec.yaml
```

### Flutter Project Status
- ✅ Flutter installed (3.41.6)
- ✅ Android SDK configured
- ✅ Project created at `D:\projects\dailyforge_flutter`
- ✅ Dependencies added (go_router, provider, http, fl_chart, lucide_icons)
- ✅ Part 1 setup complete
- ✅ Part 2 shipped (folder structure, theme, routes, glass card)
- ✅ Part 3 shipped (services layer, auth provider, JWT storage, router guards)
- ✅ Part 4 shipped (polished auth pages, 5-tab nav, splash screen, profile logout)

## Sprint 10 — Profile + Analytics + Home Redesign — Apr 16-22, 2026 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Rebuild analytics, settings, and home page.

| # | Ticket | Status | Notes |
|---|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Profile Page + Settings | ✅ Done | User info, unit toggle, menu cards, logout |
| 2 | Workout Calendar | ✅ Done | Streak counter, colored dots, month nav, session detail sheet |
| 3 | Exercise History + Charts | ✅ Done | Pillar sections, fl_chart graphs, PR dots |
| 4 | Body Measurements | ✅ Done | Chart/list toggle, month picker, edit/delete |
| 5 | Home Page Redesign (3D Body Map) | 🔄 In Progress | See S10-T5-DESIGN.md for full details |
| 5-prep | - Blender mesh split (27/27) | ✅ Done | 26 muscle meshes + base. File: `D:\projects\dailyforge\media\3d-source\male_anatomy_split_fbx.blend` |
| 5a | - 3D Body Map UI + Rotation + Tap (mock data) | ✅ Done (architecture) | Package (interactive_3d) validated, data layer shipped, selection/tap working. UX/visual polish deferred to post-Blender-resplit (see FUTURE_SCOPE items #93-#102). Committed Apr 23, 2026. |
| 5b | - Backend Endpoints (muscle heatmap, flexibility, recent wins) | 🟢 Unblocked | 1-2 days. API response shape must match the client contract already defined in `lib/data/mock_body_map_data.dart` (Flutter app, S10-T5a commit `8cdb6a8`): `Map<String, int>` for muscle volumes and flexibility scores keyed by group/region name; `MockMuscleDetail` struct for per-muscle card data; same `mockRecentWins` shape for wins list. Treat that file as the source-of-truth contract, not the other way around. |
| 5c | - Remaining Home Sections + Real Data Wiring | ⏳ Planned | 3-4 days. |

**Status (Apr 22):** T1-T4 shipped. T5-prep complete. T5a unblocked, ready for Claude Code prompt.

## Key Learnings

- **Apr 17, 2026 learning:** Blender can silently hang on specific GLB files during interactive mesh operations (Tab into Edit Mode), even after a successful import and even across Blender versions. Always have a troubleshooting ladder ready for mesh editing tasks — never assume "import worked → editing will work." Document workarounds up front.

- **Apr 20, 2026 learning:** FBX conversion is the reliable workaround for GLB Edit Mode hangs. Blender's Text Editor runs multi-line Python scripts correctly; the Python interactive console does NOT (breaks at indentation). Always use the Text Editor + Alt+P for anything with indented blocks.

- **Apr 20, 2026 learning:** Coordinate-bounds Python scripts give 70-85% accuracy for roughly-rectangular muscle regions. Boundary imperfections compensate across muscles (over-reach on chest = smaller delt, net zero lost faces). Accept imperfections and move on rather than iterate toward perfection — iteration has diminishing returns on muscle-by-muscle basis.

- **Apr 20, 2026 learning:** Split mesh granularly (30 sub-meshes) even when current DB only needs 11 groups. Code-level grouping layer makes the mesh future-ready without re-splitting later. The expensive operation (Blender splitting) is one-time; the grouping decision (Flutter code) is cheap to change.

- **Apr 20, 2026 learning:** For bootstrapped products, prefer one-time cost solutions over subscription solutions. Option C ($5 one-time LLM) beats Option B ($10-25/mo API) for v1 launch. Revisit paid paths once the app has revenue.

- **Apr 20, 2026 evening learning:** After `P → Selection`, Blender creates a new object with `.001` suffix. The original object keeps its name but loses the split faces. Always rename the NEW `.001` object to the muscle name — never rename the original (longest-named one). Verify by clicking each object in outliner and watching what highlights in viewport.

- **Apr 20, 2026 evening learning:** Renaming in Edit Mode works fine — no need to Tab out first. Object names are independent of edit state.

- **Apr 20, 2026 evening learning:** After every split, the main body's suffix increments (`.001` → `.002` → `.003`). Always click the longest-named object to continue splitting from the main body.

- **Apr 23, 2026 learning:** `interactive_3d` package treats native as the source of truth for selection state. Bidirectional sync from Dart → native (imperatively calling `clearSelections()` on state transitions) creates a race condition with the native input pipeline — symptoms were taps dropping after the first and intermittent rotation. Fix: let native own selection, drop reactive clear calls, use only one explicit clear on mode switch (an isolated user-driven event). General principle: with small-audience packages that wrap native renderers, the native side usually owns more state than the API surface suggests. Prefer one-way observation (Flutter reads native state via callbacks) over two-way sync.

- **Apr 23, 2026 learning:** Coordinate-bounds mesh splits (used for arms in particular) produce highlight regions that don't match user expectation of where a muscle "is." Bicep split in particular covers only ~30-40% of the perceived bicep surface on the rendered figure. Fix requires re-doing the Blender split with Circle Select for rounded/curvy muscles, not re-export settings. Decision: complete all visual/interaction polish after Blender re-split, since polishing highlight behavior on meshes being replaced is wasted work.

- **Apr 23, 2026 learning:** When scoping backend endpoints for features whose Flutter client already exists (even in mock form), treat the mock data files as the API contract. Saves a round-trip of "build API → adapt client → find mismatch → fix API." For T5b specifically, `lib/data/mock_body_map_data.dart` defines the exact response shapes expected. General principle: whichever side of the client/server boundary ships first defines the contract; the other side conforms.

## How This File Works

- PM (Claude.ai) creates tickets during sprint planning
- After each ticket ships, update status to ✅ Done + date
- At sprint retro, review what shipped and plan next sprint
- Flutter rebuild uses same sprint process, different codebase
